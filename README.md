# DSA-with-Solidity
I wanted to learn solidity in deep that's why I have started a challenge of solving a Data Structure and Algorithm problems using solidity.

Its really fascinating as I am literally getting introduced to new concepts every problem.

I have solved few questions so far and I will be adding more questions in the future.
